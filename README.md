<h1 align="center">Image Processing :camera::wrench:</h1>

## Abstract :pushpin:
This work has the purpose of putting into practice the discipline of Digital Image Processing. Concepts such as: fundamentals of digital images, intensity transformations, spatial filtering for smoothing, spatial filtering for sharpening, segmentation for edge detection and segmentation for thresholding are discussed. We used the Python language and the Anaconda environment (with Python scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-image) for algorithm implementations and manipulations of respective images.

## Results :chart_with_upwards_trend::clipboard:
After the implementations of the algorithms, tests were made and the changes observed that each technique results in an image. The importance of digital image processing techniques is very obvious, since the images can be generated from different resolutions (and conditions), so an improvement according to the intended purpose is required.
